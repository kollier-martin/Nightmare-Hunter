# Nightmare-Hunter
Game project for my Games Programming 1 Class. 
Goal: Traverse a custom-made map to hunt nightmares that are plaguing your mind. The premise is that the player is sleeping and that they awake in an unknown place, not knowing that they are in their dreams. The places are unfamiliar because of a certain event that happened that led to the player losing their memories. The end game is to find out what happened and restore your memories once you begin to realize that it is all a dream.
